# Metal007Rampage01

I found this great tutorial, [nicklockwood/RetroRampage](https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage), that creates a Wolfenstien 3D esque engine using UImage. There's a lot of create stuff in there about making a game so I'm going to see if I can make it work with Metal. Should be exciting!
