     * Have to make sure you assign the MTKView delegate to a variables otherwise `draw()` can't be called on it. I
     * think it's because it goes out of scope after viewDidLoad() is called. So it gets setup all the way and then
     * disappears. I wonder how it works that a delegate object can disappear but not cause the application to explode.
     * There must ge a guard that checks the delegate and just returns when nothing is there.

     * I'm currently only planning this to be a one window app so maybe that's overkill. I suspect it may be a somewhat
     * useful piece of knowledge to have in the future. Thus, I went one level up and plan to initialize the required
     * objects at that level. I suspect it may be helpful to figure out how to have an initial view controller that
     * loads the app and then opens the first window that should be open for the app. I don't know how to do fancy stuff
     * like that yet so I am going to stay away from it and use the builder here instead.
