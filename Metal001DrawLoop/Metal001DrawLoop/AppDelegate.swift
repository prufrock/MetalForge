        // Pass the Drawer.Builder into the view controller. This is to allow the Drawer to be initialized with all of
        // the bits it needs to run that could be shared across many "Drawers": MTLDevice, MTLLibrary, MTLPipelines,
        // models, etc. It's also helpful to delay attaching to the MTLView as the view delegate. The moment that
        // happens drawing starts and everything needs to be ready for that.
